This docker image provides an extended fork of [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) which has been modified to include an embedded SSH server within the docker container.

To simply use the latest stable version with SSH, run

    docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 -p 22:22 -e EULA=TRUE -e SSH=TRUE markichu/minecraft-server-ssh

-p 25565:25565 exposes the containers 25565 port to your local machines 25565 port. This is necessary to allow other players to join the Minecraft server.

-p 22:22 exposes the containers 22 port to your local machines 22 port. This is necessary to allow SSH connection into the container.

-e EULA=TRUE agrees to the EULA to allow the server to pass Mojangâ€™s EULA requirements.

-e SSH=TRUE enables the SSH server to run with the default username and password of `user` and `pass`.

## SSH Environment Variables
